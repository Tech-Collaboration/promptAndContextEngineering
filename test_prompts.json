    "prompt1": "Please provide a detailed explanation of how the transformer architecture functions in natural language processing, including an overview of self-attention, positional encoding, and how transformers improve upon recurrent neural networks. Try to include technical details while keeping it understandable to a non-expert reader.",

    "prompt2": "You are a professional summarizer. Please read the following passage carefully. Your job is to summarize it accurately, precisely, and concisely. The goal is to ensure key details are captured without unnecessary verbosity or repetition. Please make sure you also mention important concepts and do not leave out any crucial facts. Ensure the summary is short, professional, and suitable for a business or technical audience. Now, here is the text to summarize: Large language models (LLMs) are advanced neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These models, such as GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, have revolutionized natural language processing by enabling tasks like text summarization, translation, code generation, and creative writing. They work using transformer architectures that rely heavily on self-attention mechanisms to understand contextual relationships between words in a sentence or paragraph. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers can process all words simultaneously, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies more efficiently. However, LLMs are also resource-intensive, often requiring powerful GPUs or TPUs for training and inference. This makes them costly to deploy at scale. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring model compression, quantization, and knowledge distillation techniques to reduce computation without sacrificing performance. As the field evolves, the focus has shifted toward making these models more efficient, explainable, and safe for real-world applications.In summary, large language models represent a major leap forward in AI but bring with them challenges related to scalability, cost, and ethics. Their impact on industries such as education, healthcare, and software development is profound, and ongoing research aims to make them more accessible and responsible for broader use."
